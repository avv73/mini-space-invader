# mini-space-invader
Simple game I made during one of my programming lectures at the Software University. The game works in a simple manner, the player has to shoot the stars on 
the console that are randomly appearing using the keyboard keys and the space. Once a star is hit, another will spawn again at a random position. The objective
is to hit 10 stars, at which the player wins. If the player misses, the game will end, displaying the score.
There are some improvements that could be made, for example implementing some of the core game mechanics as methods. Also new features can be added, such as 
high-score ladder and infinite number of points, causing the game to be unbeatable. I will be implementing those in the future. 
Commitments are welcome and encouraged! Be sure to leave detailed commitment notes!
